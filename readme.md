## How should I use this template?

* Clone the folder or download the zip.
* Install requirements (flask, flask_sqlalchemy,sql alchemy) by doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* In JSON path, use '/' if you are using linux operating system and '\' if you are using windows operating system. I'm not sure how macintosh handles path specifiers.
* Run book-shoppe.py as  "python book-shoppe.py" or "py book-shoppe.py" depending upon your python version. If you are unsure, you can check it by running command "python --version".
